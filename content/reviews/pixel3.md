## TL;DR

* It is a Very Good™ Phone
* It has a Very Good™ Camera, both front and rear
* Google Assistant is helpful and intuitive to use
* If you're in the market for a new flagship smart phone, this is the one you should buy

## Preface

I have been using iPhones for about 9 years, starting with the iPhone 3GS in 2009. I have owned an iPhone 3GS, 4, 5s, and 6s. I have 3 MacBook Pros, and am on my second iPad. I owned an Apple Watch for quite a while. I have on many occassions, both public and private, mocked non-Apple products. Needless to say, I have been heavily entangled in the Apple ecosystem. The same goes for my wife Leah, though while I am in general a gadget hound and tech enthusiast, she is really just looking for things to not get in her way, and is fairly averse to change.

We recently both made the switch to the Pixel 3 from the iPhone 6s, thanks to a pretty sweet incentive from [Google Fi](https://g.co/fi/r/U5XAXJ) ($800 bill credit if you buy 2 new Pixel 3 phones and bring them to Fi). This review chronicles our experience with this transition, mostly from my perspective, with notes from Leah to offer the perspective of a less technical person as well.

## Getting Set Up

* **Ease**: 10/10
* **Speed**: 10/10

I was definitely concerned that migrating my whole iOS world to an Android problem would present signficant friction, but this concern was wholly unfounded. It comes with this handy adapter: ![usb-c to usb-a adapter][usb-adapter]

This is usb-c(male) on one end, and usb-a(female) on the other. You plug the usb-c end into your pixel, and then connect a lightning cable between your iPhone and the usb-a end. It was able to automatically transfer my apps, photos, contacts, and texts.

Besides this, I only needed to manually disable iMessages and Facetime in settings on my iPhone (as instructed during the setup process), and the transition was complete. The Fi app handled transfering my number over, and I was really fully up and operational within less than hour, including the pretty hefty data transfer.

Leah also completed her transition within the same time frame, and needed no assistance for this.

## First Impressions

The device itself is very polished, and has a premium feel to it. The two-tone glass back looks and feels very nice. I almost decided to skip putting a case on it, because I really like the appearance of the naked phone.

One of the first obvious differences between my iPhone 6s and this is the location of the fingerprint sensor. Whereas it is located on the bottom of the front face on an iPhone: ![iPhone 6s][iphone-6s]

It is located high-center on the back of the phone on the Pixel 3: ![Pixel 3 Back][pixel-3-back]

I this is better for a few reasons.

* The fingerprint sensor no longer takes up precious front-of-phone real-estate, and as a result the Pixel 3 has a much larger screen, even though the total dimensions of the device are extremely similar.

>  | iPhone 6s | Pixel 3
---|-----------|---------
**Display** | **120mm** | **140mm**
Height | 138.3mm   | 145.6mm
Width | 67.1mm    | 68.2mm
Depth | 7.1mm     | 7.9mm
Weight | 143g | 148g

* I find it more comfortable to find the rear fingerprint sensor with my index finger than to adjust my whole grip to hit the front sensor with my thumb.

* There is a gesture you can enable that lets you flick your finger over the sensor to pull your notifications down from the top of the screen. This is signficantly more comfortable than the awkward whole hand stretch required otherwise.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the newest iPhones do not have a fingerprint sensor at all, and instead rely on facial recognition to authenticate users of the device. Personally, I find this creepy as hell, and I prefer an easy-to-use fingerprint sensor to the facial recognition system.

The rear fingerprint sensor isn't all good news though. I will say that it's harder to unlock your phone while it's sitting face-up on a table. With my iPhone, I could just tap the front sensor to unlock the phone, but with the Pixel I either need to pick up the phone or type in my passcode. In practice, this is not that inconvenient because of some software features like Trusted Locations that keep the phone from locking while I'm at home, or while it's on my Pixel Stand.

The device is fast and responsive, and gets identical wifi performance to my laptop (2018 Macbook Pro): 200Mbps down, 25Mbps up (in my office)

## Display

The display is a 5.5 in (140 mm) FHD+ OLED at 443 ppi (2160x1080), and it's really gorgeous. The image appears to sit right on the surface of the screen, not behind a thick pane of glass. The colors are vivid, and images and videos look sharp.

It supports 3 different color profiles:

### 1. Natural

![Natural Colors][natural-colors]

### 2. Boosted

![Boosted Colors][boosted-colors]

### 3. Adaptive

![Adaptive Colors][adaptive-colors]

The default is Adaptive, but I have mine set to Natural.
