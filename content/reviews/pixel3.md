## Preface

I have been using iPhones for about 9 years, starting with the iPhone 3GS in 2009. I have owned an iPhone 3GS, 4, 5s, and 6s. I have 3 MacBook Pros, and am on my second iPad. I owned an Apple Watch for quite a while. I have on many occassions, both public and private, mocked non-Apple products. Needless to say, I have been heavily entangled in the Apple ecosystem. The same goes for my wife Leah, though while I am in general a gadget hound and tech enthusiast, she is really just looking for things to not get in her way, and is fairly averse to change.

We recently both made the switch to the Pixel 3 from the iPhone 6s, thanks to a pretty sweet incentive from [Google Fi](https://g.co/fi/r/U5XAXJ) ($800 bill credit if you buy 2 new Pixel 3 phones and bring them to Fi). This review chronicles our experience with this transition, mostly from my perspective, with notes from Leah to offer the perspective of a less technical person as well.

## Getting Set Up

* **Ease**: 10/10
* **Speed**: 10/10

I was definitely concerned that migrating my whole iOS world to an Android problem would present signficant friction, but this concern was wholly unfounded. It comes with this handy adapter: ![usb-c to usb-a adapter][usb-adapter]

This is usb-c(male) on one end, and usb-a(female) on the other. You plug the usb-c end into your pixel, and then connect a lightning cable between your iPhone and the usb-a end. It was able to automatically transfer my apps, photos, contacts, and texts.

Besides this, I only needed to manually disable iMessages and Facetime in settings on my iPhone (as instructed during the setup process), and the transition was complete. The Fi app handled transfering my number over, and I was really fully up and operational within less than hour, including the pretty hefty data transfer.

Leah also completed her transition within the same time frame, and needed no assistance for this.

## First Impressions

The device itself is very polished, and has a premium feel to it. The two-tone glass back looks and feels very nice. I almost decided to skip putting a case on it, because I really like the appearance of the naked phone.

One of the first obvious differences between my iPhone 6s and this is the location of the fingerprint sensor. Whereas it is located on the bottom of the front face on an iPhone: ![iPhone 6s][iphone-6s]

It is located high-center on the back of the phone on the Pixel 3: ![Pixel 3 Back][pixel-3-back]

I this is better for a few reasons.

* The fingerprint sensor no longer takes up precious front-of-phone real-estate, and as a result the Pixel 3 has a much larger screen, even though the total dimensions of the device are extremely similar.

>  | iPhone 6s | Pixel 3
---|-----------|---------
**Display** | **120mm** | **140mm**
Height | 138.3mm   | 145.6mm
Width | 67.1mm    | 68.2mm
Depth | 7.1mm     | 7.9mm
Weight | 143g | 148g

* I find it more comfortable to find the rear fingerprint sensor with my index finger than to adjust my whole grip to hit the front sensor with my thumb.

* There is a gesture you can enable that lets you flick your finger over the sensor to pull your notifications down from the top of the screen. This is signficantly more comfortable than the awkward whole hand stretch required otherwise.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the newest iPhones do not have a fingerprint sensor at all, and instead rely on facial recognition to authenticate users of the device. Personally, I find this creepy as hell, and I prefer an easy-to-use fingerprint sensor to the facial recognition system.

The rear fingerprint sensor isn't all good news though. I will say that it's harder to unlock your phone while it's sitting face-up on a table. With my iPhone, I could just tap the front sensor to unlock the phone, but with the Pixel I either need to pick up the phone or type in my passcode. In practice, this is not that inconvenient because of some software features like Trusted Locations that keep the phone from locking while I'm at home, or while it's on my Pixel Stand.

The device is fast and responsive, and gets identical wifi performance to my laptop (2018 Macbook Pro): 200Mbps down, 25Mbps up (in my office)

## Display

The display is a 5.5 in (140 mm) FHD+ OLED at 443 ppi (2160x1080), and it's really gorgeous. The image appears to sit right on the surface of the screen, not behind a thick pane of glass. The colors are vivid, and images, videos, and text look clear and sharp.

It supports 3 different color profiles:

### 1. Natural

![Natural Colors][natural-colors]

### 2. Boosted

![Boosted Colors][boosted-colors]

### 3. Adaptive

![Adaptive Colors][adaptive-colors]

The default is Adaptive, but I have mine set to Natural.

## Home Screen

![Homescreen, with my calanders obscured][homescreen-full]

If you're coming from iOS, the homescreen experience is fairly different, and in my opinion better.

!["At a Glance" features][homescreen-top]

Starting from the top, we've got the time, date, day of the week, and weather all visible all the time, along with information about connections, volume, battery life, etc.

![Widget space][homescreen-widgets]

Next, theres an area you can arrange app icons, folders, or widgets. I have my personal google calendar and my work outlook calendar here, and it's really nice to have my upcoming events available at a glance like that, as a 0-step interaction.

![Icons and Search][homescreen-bottom]

I like the circular icons better than rounded squares in iOS, but that's certainly just a personal preference. What I really like is having a search bar right on the home screen. It searches your phone locally, as well as serving as a general purpose google search bar, similar to the spotlight search in iOS accessed by pulling down on the home screen. However, I really feel that search deserves to be a first class citizen in your mobile OS, so the approach of putting the search bar directly on the home screen is better to me. The little bubble icon on the right side of that search bar summons the assistant, as does holding the software home button below.

![Switch tasks, suggested apps][homescreen-quick-pull]

If you pull up from the bottom of the phone, you'll see this interface, which allows you to switch between apps, use the search bar, or open one of 5 suggested apps. These apps appear to be suggested based on a variety of contextual factors, and what I need is frequently present here.

![All apps][all-apps]

If you pull up again from the app-switching screen, you'll see a scrollable list of all apps you have installed, along with some additional intelligent suggestions.

You'll notice that the home button is present in all of these interfaces, along with the back button. These things will be present in everything except full screen videos or games. Even though it's a software home button, it does still provide a tactile clicky feedback when you press it.

## Lock Screen

![Lock Screen][lock-screen]

The lock screen retains the "at a glance" features of the home screen, which I really like, especially the date and weather info. You can have the lock screen background match your wallpaper, like I have done, but it's not required. The phone unlocks either by pulling up on the screen and entering your PIN, or touching the fingerprint sensor on the back.

## Keyboard

The keyboard is pretty good for a smartphone keyboard. It provides tactile feedback when you type, which I like, but you can disable if you don't. 

For password fields, it provides a number row on top of the regular keyboard so that you don't have to switch back and forth between alphabet and numerical keyboards so frequently while typing in complex passwords. Thankfully, it will save your passwords in chrome's password manager for you, so you only have to type these passwords in once. Still, it definitely improves the password typing experience.

For other text fields, such as in messages, numbers share a key with the top row. You can access them by holding the appropriate key instead of tapping it. I like this approach better than the iOS approach of having the switch to the numbers keyboard everytime you need a number.

## Camera

Both the rear-facing and front-facing cameras on this phone are very good. I am consistently impressed with the quality of photos taken, and the types of photo available to take.

### Selfie Camera

![My friend Alli and me at Seminole Canyon State Park][selfie]

The big new thing on the front-facing camera for the Pixel 3 is that it uses 2 lenses to provide a feature that lets you "zoom out" on your selfies. When this feature was announced, I really did not care at all, because I have never been a big selfie taker. However, I find myself using this feature almost every day. It dramatically improves the experience of taking selfies, because you can fit more people in them in more easily, and you can include impressive scenery in your shots, without requiring the use of a selfie-stick.

### Rear-Facing Camera
