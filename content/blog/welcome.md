Welcome to Shawn Reviews Things. I find myself with a lot of opinions on the things I interact with, so I made myself this website. I haven't really committed to a category of thing, so expect pretty diverse reviews: gadgets, restaurants, web services, open source packages, dogs, etc. It might include tutorials and stuff, too. Who knows!?

## Who am I?

I'm Shawn Rushefsky. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [GLG](https://glg.it/). I'm a life-long coder and tinkerer, as well as a fairly enthusiastic woodworker.
